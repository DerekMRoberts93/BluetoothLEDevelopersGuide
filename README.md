Bluetooth LE developers guide 522 project

Course project for Wireless Networking Course

I Followed a developers guide from the Bluetooth SIG and created a simple bluetooth LE profile.
  I have uploaded the developers guide I followed to learn Bluetooth LE

Used a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as the GATT server.  
  The server can start an alarm, measure temperature, and alert on link loss. 
  Server code is labeled bdsk.js (node.js) 
  
Used a Android smart phone as a GATT Client.
