Bluetooth LE developers guide 522 project

Course project for Wireless Networking Course

Following a developers guide from the Bluetooth SIG I created a simple bluetooth LE profile.

Used a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as the GATT server.  The server can start an alarm, measure temperature, and alert on link loss. 
Used a Android smart phone as a GATT Client
